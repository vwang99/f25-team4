I am a senior student at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I love all kinds of music ranging from k-pop
to slam metal. My favorite artists and bands currently are Sleep Token, brakence, and PeelingFlesh. I also enjoy playing video games, I play games that range from League of
Legends to Terraria and many more.

My 340 goals for this semester are to learn about how I can apply my skills and learn more skills in the context of a team or even on my own while engineering software.
I hope I can walk out of this class with a new perspective on how to approach problems and how to work with others in a professional setting.
